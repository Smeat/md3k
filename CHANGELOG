MDK3 Changelog

version 6
* Amok Mode now works on Ad-Hoc and MANET networks (WARNING: Clients may not reconnect automatically,
  so they may stay disconnected after the attack stopped!)
* Removed duplicate WPA downgrade in Deauth Mode (sry for the confusion)
* SSID Bruteforce Mode understands 0 and 1 byte placeholders in hidden SSIDs now
* GCC 4.4 support, all warnings and extra warnings fixed
* Whitelists and Blacklists in Amok Mode are re-read periodically every 3 seconds.
  You can use this to dynamically allow or block hosts with scripts.
* A lot of small bugfixes

version 5
* Enhanced MAC-Filter Bruteforce Mode
* Another WDS/WIDS/WIPS Confusion Test
* Amok Mode supports QoS packets
* Michael Countermeasure Exploit (also known as TKIP QoS Exploit)
  can shut down APs using TKIP encryption and QoS Extension with 1 sniffed and 2 injected QoS Data Packets.
* WPA-Downgrade Test - deauthenticates Stations and APs sending WPA encrypted packets.
  With this test you can check if the sysadmin will try setting his network to WEP or disable encryption.
  mdk3 will let WEP and unencrypted clients work, so if the sysadmin simply thinks "WPA is broken" he sure isn't the right one for this job.
  (this can/should be combined with social engineering)
