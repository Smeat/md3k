MDK3 TODO List

Current version:
0003

IMPORTANT:
     SSID Bruteforce reported to not work anymore with osdep!
DONE Check if ToDS and FromDS bits are set correctly for EVERY attack
     MAC filter bruteforcer
DONE channel hopper for amok
     and authdos attack
     Add Ace's SSID bruteforce enhancement patch
      http://tinyshell.be/aircrackng/forum/index.php?topic=1852
      -> Recognize SSID length 0 and 1 as FULL hidden
       -> Maybe run a quick 256er to check if the length may really be just 1 byte ;)
     Add ad-hoc compatibility
     change from GPLv2 to GPLv2 or later

Unfinished:
- ZC says: standard auth dos stops after the first 500 and doesnt find another AP
- standard auth dos should go up to 600 instead of 500 (because 512 kills a lot of people)
- Intelligent AuthDOS with Shared Key Auth
- one function for ssid_brute and ssid_brute_real
- SSID Bruteforce Attack - Memory problem with long wordlists
DONE                     - Doesnt start sometimes
-                        - Read Wordlist from stdin
- CTS control frame flooding (What does a CTS flood cause?)
- Add support for changing tx speed and tx power to avoid locating the attack (WIDS evasion)

Done:
DONE auth dos response checker needs packet detection
DONE get_target_ap should only work on beacon frames!
DONE APs sending no beacon frames then have to be targetted via -a option
DONE When faking BSSID on channel X, the adaptor should also send on channel X
DONE fixing auth dos stopping when not finding new target
DONE Full Assoc/Auth (like aireplay) DoS
DONE More variety to beacon parameters (WEP, WPA, Open, 54 MBit, adhoc...)
DONE Invalid (Beacon) frames generator
DONE Probe Check doesnt work on rt2570, Driver issue? Fix?
DONE Fixed Channel in Beacon flood mode
DONE Fixed MAC in Beacon flood mode
DONE Single mode (Client/AP) for Amokmode -> Zero's Whitelist mode
DONE Use random VALID MAC adresses (from OUI database) instead of really random ones.
WONTDO pcap replay including correct timing. (useful for honeypot, fakeIV) -> use airtun-ng
DONE Hopping thread for amok mode
DONE Add Zero_Chaos Makefile
DONE Add Ace SSID wordlist patch
DONE Improve SSID wordlist speed (threading), let it sniff one beacon to get SSID length, check if SSID may be just empty and not hidden.
DONE Add ACK frames to all attacks
DONE --help option, divide help screen into several pages, or --longhelp for the whole screen
DONE beacon flood mode with AdHoc, WDS and WPA(2) networks
DONE blacklist mode, only attack MACs specified

EAP attacks:

DONE 802.11 TKIP MIC Exploit
     Generating invalid TKIP data to exceed the target AP's MIC error threshold, suspending WLAN service.

DONE 802.1X EAP-Start Flood
Flooding an AP with EAP-Start messages to consume resources or crash the target.

802.1X EAP-Failure
Observing a valid 802.1X EAP exchange, and then sending the station a forged EAP-Failure message.

802.1X EAP-of-Death
Sending a malformed 802.1X EAP Identity response known to cause some APs to crash.

802.1X EAP Length Attacks
Sending EAP type-specific messages with bad length fields to try to crash an AP or RADIUS server.
